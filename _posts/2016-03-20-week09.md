This week, we will begin our study of probability theory.

We will also go over the midterms in class on Monday.  For the curious among you, the curve formula used was: Curved Grade = 40 + 0.6*(Raw Score).  The mean raw score was about 73; the mean curved score was about 84.  

### Reading

Please read Chapter 7 of the course packet, on probability.

### Exercises
