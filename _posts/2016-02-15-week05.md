On Monday, we will finish up Chapter 4 of the course packet.  Key topics:  
* review of ANOVA  
* Numerical and grouping variables together  
* Correlation among the predictors (collinearity)  


On Wednesday, we will start with Chapter 5 of the course packet.  Key topics:   
* sampling distributions   
* bootstrapping   
* introduction to confidence intervals  


### Software

Outside of class, complete the following R walkthroughs.  
* [Gone fishing](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/gonefishing/gonefishing.html): using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the sampling distributions of the sample mean and of the least-squares estimator  
* [Creatinine, revisited](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/creatinine/creatinine_bootstrap.html): bootstrapping the sample mean and the OLS estimator; computing confidence intervals from bootstrapped samples.  


### Readings

Please finish Chapter 4 of the course packet and read Chapter 5 up through page 116.  


### Exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises04-STA371H.pdf) are about sampling distributions and bootstrapping.    

My take on the [last set of exercises](not posted yet) will be available Monday evening.  The corresponding R script is available through the R Scripts tab, above.
